William (Jerry) Moore (1859-1927), surgeon, was born on 30 July 1859 at Western Suburbs (Milton), Brisbane, third son of William Moore, gardener and later Baptist minister from Somerset, England, and his Welsh wife Margaret, née Hitchings. Entering the University of Melbourne in 1878 from Brisbane Grammar School with the nickname 'Jerry' and a high scholastic record, he graduated M.B. in 1882 and B.S. in 1883, dux of his year. He was house surgeon at the (Royal) Melbourne Hospital in 1883-84 and afterwards demonstrator in anatomy at the university. Following his marriage on 29 April 1884 at Hotham Hill to Grace Emily Poole, governess and Baptist clergyman's daughter, he resumed his studies to become the first recipient of the University of Melbourne's M.S. degree, conferred in 1885 at the same ceremony as his M.D.

'Jerry' Moore was appointed surgeon for skin diseases at the Melbourne Hospital in 1885 and in 1887 out-patient surgeon. Commencing private practice in Spring Street, in 1890 he took over the Collins Street practice of E. M. James, a senior hospital colleague and a timely and benevolent patron. He continued at the Melbourne Hospital, as surgeon on the full staff from 1902, until 1910 when he became consulting surgeon; he was also honorary surgeon to St Vincent's Hospital in 1899-1906, a member of the committee of the Austin Hospital in 1895-1907 and one of the few surgeons to run his own private hospital, Milton House, in Flinders Lane.

The amount and variety of surgery which Moore undertook was prodigious and his results, published in pamphlets and in numerous contributions to the *Intercolonial Medical Journal of Australia*, outstanding. By 1908 his reputation was such that Melbourne *Punch* termed him 'the perfect surgeon'. He was pre-eminent in two directions: he led in the application of Listerism to abdominal surgery, demonstrating new standards of lower mortality rates; and he had a special interest and skill in reconstructive surgery on which he published one of the earliest books, *Plastic Surgery*, in 1899. His work in this field at the 11th Australian General Hospital during and after World War I was far advanced for his time.

Moore's greatest contribution to the Melbourne Hospital was his abolition of the system of hospital appointment by public canvass and vote. Successively promoting the appointment of allies to the hospital board---he was a member himself in 1904-25---he achieved his objective in 1910 with the establishment of the independent electoral college system of appointments. In 1886 he had been a strong advocate for moving the Melbourne Hospital from Lonsdale Street to its present Parkville site, but was outvoted. He was also critical of the charge levied on patients, believing the hospital should remain a charitable institution for the underprivileged.

As a student Moore helped to found the Medical Students' Society. A non-drinker and non-smoker, completely humourless and with an unattractive voice, he was the object of some ridicule by the medical student body. He had, however, the lifelong respect of many of Melbourne's leading physicians and surgeons, [(Sir) Richard Stawell](https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/stawell-richard-rawdon-8633 "Stawell, Sir Richard Rawdon (1864 - 1935)") in particular recording that Moore 'imbued a new spirit into hospital work ... in Melbourne'. Later served on the councils of the Medical Society of Victoria and the Victorian branch of the British Medical Association. In 1889-93 he co-edited the *Australian Medical Journal* with [(Sir) George Syme](https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/syme-george-adlington-8733 "Syme, Sir George Adlington (1859 - 1929)"). He was, nevertheless, a loner in professional circles, always self-reliant, outspoken on matters of principle and intolerant of other viewpoints. His isolation was exacerbated when in 1906 he was charged with unprofessional conduct by a colleague whose patient Moore had visited for a 'friendly chat'. An investigation involving the parent B.M.A. continued until 1911, making the case a *cause célèbre*. Though ultimately exonerated, Moore withdrew from the centre of medical affairs; he did not rejoin the B.M.A. until 1926.

Apart from surgery, sport (cricket, tennis and cycling) and the Church were said to be Moore's only interests. He loved cricket and was president of the University Cricket Club, and for many years captain and wicket–keeper of his own well known team, “The Medicos”. 

It was said that cricket, the Church and surgery were his only interests and of these he often told his friends, he liked cricket best of all.

He took up residence in Alcaston House, corner of Collins and Spring Street establishing his practice at 2 Collins Street.

During World War I with the rank of Honorary Colonel, he gave valuable services in the military hospitals at St. Kilda and Caulfield. 

Almost three city blocks west of Dr. William Moore’s residence and medical practice stood the Collins Street Baptist Church.  William Moore was a staunch Baptist and nearby was his church where he was a member for some fifty years and a dedicated Elder.  He was a leading light in all affairs of the Baptist Union of Victoria especially its financial matters.  He was President of the Baptist Theological College.

As a dedicated Baptist, he initiated the founding of Carey Baptist Grammar School where his name remains on a foundation stone and in Moore House. 

Rev. Leonard E. Tranter’s early manhood years in Canada convinced him how vital to a religious denomination was a progressive education system.  The story of his long and difficult struggle to convince the Baptist Union of this necessity is written and acknowledged elsewhere as is his ultimate triumph.

One of his supporters in his appeal for a Baptist school was Dr.  William Moore.  He was an active and wise member, Chairman of some of the meetings of the Committee set up to further this object.  He was a person who never seemed to have any doubts about anything, including religion and his absolute sincerity of his views and actions were recognised.  Here then was an advocate in strong support of the establishment of a boys’ school in Melbourne.  As an earnest of his own determination to achieve such an outcome, on November 16th 1920, the first donation to the funds was received from Dr. William Moore.  He became the first President of the Council of Carey Baptist Grammar School.

In the grounds of Carey, by the 1884 house ‘Urangeline’ on Saturday February 10th 1923, Mrs. Moore wife of Dr. Moore, the President, formally declared the School open by turning the symbolic key.  In a very brief speech she stressed the definite Christian ideals which are integral in our education policy, and expressed her conviction that the boys who spent their impressionable years in Carey would become good and great men.

Saturday 31st January 1925, the President of the Council Dr. William Moore declared the foundation stone of the new Preparatory School, ‘well and truly laid’, and was presented with the traditional silver trowel.  It was his last formal function as President–at a subsequent meeting of the Council that same day he submitted his resignation.  He was then described as, ‘the hardest and most indefatigable of the School’s enthusiastic workers.’ 

Moore died suddenly at Fitzroy on 8 September 1927 before he could take his seat on the first credentials committee of the College of Surgeons of Australasia to which he had been elected a foundation fellow earlier in the year. Buried in Box Hill cemetery, he was survived by his wife, four daughters and a son.

WILLIAM HAROLD JAMES MOORE
(1937 - 1953)
Harold Moore died on 22nd August 1975 in his 83rd year.
In 1937 the appointment of Harold Moore as Honorary Urologist to the Women’s Hospital constituted a landmark in the evolution of
obstetrics and gynaecology in Victoria, because if represented the first clinical splitting-off of a subspecialty within those disciplines,
a process begun with the Hospital’s appointing Vera Krieger, DSc and the late Hildred Butler, DSc as biochemist and bacteriologist
and continued with the engagement of the late Hans Bettinger as pathologist and the establishment of the medical reference clinic
of WMcI Rose and MJ Etheridge.
The weekly urological clinic, conducted under the control of the late Colin Macdonald’s nurse-radiographer, Miss Mathilde Blythe,
was the first systematic use by the Hospital of one of its consultants. With the development of infertility work under JW Johnstone,
soon an additional clinic became necessary for testicular biopsy. A soft-voiced diffident man with a pleasant smile and an alert eye,
Harold Moore served the Hospital for 16 years. His successor was Douglas B Duffy, himself succeeded in 1966 by David Kennedy.
William Harold James Moore was the only son of Dr. William and Grace Emily Moore; he had four sisters Margaret, Mildred, Enid
and Dorothy. He was born on 31st December 1893 at Alcaston House - a substantial predecessor of the present handsome
building - on the corner of Collins and Spring Streets, Melbourne, where were his surgeon-father’s consulting rooms and where the
family was to continue to live until Harold was 20.
After some initial schooling he attended Scotch College between 1905 and 1912, entered the University of Melbourne medical
school in 1913 and graduated Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery in 1917. At the (Royal) Melbourne Hospital, where he
had been a student, he served first as Resident and Registrar, then as Honorary Surgical Clinical Assistant 1920-28, as Honorary
Clinical Assistant to the Urologist (John Thompson Tait) 1928-33, as Honorary (First) Assistant to the Urologist from 1933 and,
upon the retirement of Tait, as Honorary Urologist from 1947 to 1953.
Upon his retirement in 1953 the Royal Women’s Hospital appointed him as Honorary Consulting Surgeon.
He worked in general practice from 1922 to 1934 at his home in Kew, serving a double term as Beaney Scholar in the University
Pathology School (1922-4), gaining the degree of Master of Surgery (Melb.) in 1927 and being elected to the fellowship of the
Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in 1930.
After eight months of postgraduate work in the United Kingdom he commenced private consultant practice in Collins Street in 1935
and continued until ill-health compelled his retirement in 1972. He was a member of the Urological Society of Australasia and a late
member of the International Society of Urologists.
He had married in 1924 Miss Vera Rosenblum, a tutor in Philosophy at the University of Melbourne, and they had three children,
Bill, Anne and Barbara; Dr William Mitchell Moore, FRACP, now practices at Mount Gambier.
Harold Moore had numerous outside interests. As grandson of a Baptist Minister and son of the president of the Baptist Theological
College he was a member of the Council of Carey Grammar School from 1929, (its President 1939-52 and an Honorary Member
thereafter; his father had been the Foundation President) and a member of the Council of Whitley College in Melbourne University.
He was a keen amateur photographer, greatly enjoyed friendship and companionship, played tennis all his life and only gave up
membership of the Kew Gold Club at the age of 81 because he could no longer play. His membership of the Melbourne Cricket
Club exceeded 50 years and he was Honorary Secretary of the Wallaby Club for 13 years and its President 1957-8.
Harold Moore is survived by his widow, his children and three sisters
