Being a class clown is a full time job. Imagine dedicating every inch of your attention to watching, listening and waiting to jump in with a funny and inappropriate joke. There is one in every group, every sports club and every classroom that we work in. Maybe you were the class clown, maybe you were mate with them or maybe you were a little scared of them.

In a virtual workshop recently there was one boy that had the whole room laughing by writing some pretty rowdy things into the chat bar. I instantly jumped on the back of his jokes saying “oi, funny man! Jump off mute! I’ve gotta hear what your voice sounds like if you’re gonna be making jokes all day”.

He jumped off mute and was filled with charisma and energy. Instead of coming down on him for making jokes at potentially not the best time i just said “Mate, I love your energy, I love your charisma. I want you to keep bringing yourself into this workshop. But I wanna give you the opportunity today to not just be the funny guy.” He said yeah alright and instantly changed gears.

Flash forward a little further into the workshop and another boy was bravely sharing that over the past few weeks he had really been struggling with his mental health. I asked him who had been supporting him through it and he said “well not long ago, I reached out to *****( the class clowns name) for a chat about life and how I was going”. “Having him there trying to support me really helped. I knew that I had one guy who was always gonna have my back in tough times.”

The class clown went onto share a little bit about the guy he used to be and what he had learned from that. This legend was a walking example of how guys can be when they aren’t completed hypnotised by the male stereotype. He was able to be the class clown, while also being approachable and willing to hear his mates issues, and was able to share his own. It’s not impossible!
