The Zero Program is Carey's new Outdoor Education experience based in Townsville, Queensland. Students are given the opportunity to not only step away from their busy schedules and take a break from technology, but also to reflect on their impact on the planet and participate in meaningful conservation work at the [Australian Wildlife Conservancy](https://www.facebook.com/AWConservancy/?__cft__[0]=AZWS8CcVyiAaRWXG9zaHdr3mDXipMC60qmnqWUyLei0FdAWOmELYM4rQVbPNhcNhMDh1lXjw3D5coD66EmvFpN0sHciyKHsw_9kJaCSsB8p-Bye8oV-44JXv98oGh8Qk0-dircQ8IvwWkG1Wmug9FGS6&__tn__=kK-R)'s Mt Zero Taravale Property. This groundbreaking new program, which also includes visits to Mungalla Station and Orpheus Island, will officially launch in 2023, but in the July holidays this year the group of staff and Year 10, 11 and 12 students involved in its development piloted the experience.
