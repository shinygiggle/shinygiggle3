The Zero Program is Carey's new Outdoor Education experience based in Townsville, Queensland. Students are given the opportunity to not only step away from their busy schedules and take a break from technology, but also to reflect on their impact on the planet and participate in meaningful conservation work at the [Australian Wildlife Conservancy](https://www.facebook.com/AWConservancy/?__cft__[0]=AZWS8CcVyiAaRWXG9zaHdr3mDXipMC60qmnqWUyLei0FdAWOmELYM4rQVbPNhcNhMDh1lXjw3D5coD66EmvFpN0sHciyKHsw_9kJaCSsB8p-Bye8oV-44JXv98oGh8Qk0-dircQ8IvwWkG1Wmug9FGS6&__tn__=kK-R)'s Mt Zero Taravale Property. This groundbreaking new program, which also includes visits to Mungalla Station and Orpheus Island, will officially launch in 2023, but in the July holidays this year the group of staff and Year 10, 11 and 12 students involved in its development piloted the experience.

*‌‌*‌What are the components of the Year 10 Zero Program?‌**


There are three main elements of the 2024 Year 10 Zero Program:



The Zero Program includes the elements of a Year 10 student’s curricular and co-curricular experience throughout the course of their Year 10 year

Zero at Kew is the year-long subject delivered by the Zero Mentor, who has dual responsibility of acting as your child's first point of contact and Mentor; and, shaping and delivering the Zero at Kew course to meet the needs of the students in their group
The Zero Journey is the three-week experiential learning journey undertaken by all students. Students have chosen between the North Queensland Zero Journey and the Victorian Zero Journey.



‌Who should I communicate with regarding my child during Year 10?‌


Your first point of contact is your child’s Zero Mentor. Issues can be escalated to the Lead Zero Mentor, Year 10 Co-ordinator or Head of Senior School should it be deemed necessary.

‌Will my child remain with their Zero Mentor throughout Year 11 and Year 12?‌


No. Your child will be assigned a House Mentor for Year 11 and Year 12 although they will remain in the same House for the duration of Year 10 –12.



‌How many students have chosen to attend the North Queensland Zero Journey?‌
270. All other students will undertake the Victorian Zero Journey.



‌Will all subject areas take the same approach to curriculum during the Zero Journey term?‌


No. All subjects have designed a course and an approach that best meets the needs of their students, and is reflective of curriculum outcomes. Therefore, each subject’s curriculum structure will differ slightly. This includes the approach to assessment and examinations.

‌What are the main approaches to course work and assessment during the Zero Journey term?‌


Some subjects have chosen to implement units of work that include flexible elements. This means that not all students will engage with all elements of the unit at the same time.

In other subjects, students will complete the topics and assessments during the times they are in class, and then, complete only the relevant questions in the examination to account for their absence. Subjects following this second approach include some Humanities subjects, where common skills are developed in more than one topic.



‌Are students expected to catch up on the course work that they miss when on the Zero Journey?‌


No. Students are not expected to catch up on content and skills covered in class while on their three-week Zero Journey. Their absence has been planned for and accommodations made.



‌How will the teachers support my child to ensure they are able to manage their absence when at Zero Journey without impacting their learning?‌
All teachers are aware of each individual student’s travel dates. Each Learning Area has designed courses and learning approaches to best support the students as they step out for the three weeks of their Zero Journey. Each Learning Area was supported in 2023 to redesign courses and pedagogical approaches to accommodate for travel absences. Zero Mentors will also support their mentees to best prepare for their absence, and then to reengage with their subjects upon their return.



‌Will Year 10 students complete examinations?‌


Yes, students will complete an examination in most subjects, once in the semester. These examinations will take place in class time.

‌Will a student’s travel dates impact when they sit examinations?‌


Yes. Please see below for a summary of Term (or Semester) examinations.



In most cases, students whose Zero Journey is in Term 3 will have an in-class examination at the end of Term 2 and students whose Zero Journey is in Term 2 will have an in-class examination at the end of Term 1 or Term 2. Most subjects will have an in-class examination at the end of Term 4. Biology, Chemistry and Physics are term- based units which will have an in-class examination at the end of each term.



Teachers will provide specific detail for their classes.

‌Will there be an examination timetable?‌


Yes. Each student will have access to a schedule outlining the arrangements for the semester. In Term 2, these examinations will be held from Tuesday 11 June (the day after the King’s Birthday Public Holiday) to Wednesday 19 June. Students will sit no more than one Year 10 examination each day. Subject teachers will communicate examination dates to students well in advance.



‌My child is doing a VCE subject, how are they being supported?‌


Year 11 subject teachers will support Year 10 students in their class, both pre-departure and upon their return. Depending on the subject, this could include alternative SAC dates, minimised course work requirements and flexible due dates.



‌What is the curriculum structure for Zero at Kew, and what ‘topics’ or ‘focus areas’ will be covered?‌
The Year 10 subject of Zero at Kew is a year-long course with three periods per fortnightly cycle, and has been carefully planned to support our students to consider their strengths and interests as a learner and where they might like their learning to take them within and beyond Carey. Our Year 10 Program also supports students to consider what kind of person they are and what kind of adult they would like to become.



The Zero at Kew course aims to empower our Year 10 students by nurturing their Physical, Spiritual, Emotional, Social Mental Academic wellbeing, while also fostering leadership skills, future planning, and essential life skills. These curriculum themes have informed the formation of eight learning units across the year. These units will be implemented in a modular fashion based on each Mentor group’s program dates, and in some cases will be adjusted in response to student voice and need.



Our 2024 Zero at Kew units are Pre-Trip Readiness; Pre-Trip Learning; Personal Pathways; Learning Skills; Leadership Development; Resilience, Rights and Respectful Relationships, and a Learning Expedition culminating in a project. Each of these units have a student and parent facing CANVAS Page which can be explored at any time. These CANVAS pages will evolve over time.



The curriculum is being delivered through a pedagogy shaped by circle time; and, First Nations and Expedition learning principles. These principles emphasise the power of a group; the importance of leaving no-one behind; hands-on experiential learning; connecting students with real-world contexts; and fostering a deep understanding of cultures and perspectives.



A key element of this subject is the 1-1 Mentor conversations that Mentors will have with their mentees as the year progresses. The conversations will focus on each student’s academic development, challenges and achievements; social and emotional development; and, contribution to the Zero group, including their ability to demonstrate elements of range of complex personal and learning competencies.



At times, these conversations and students’ self-reported needs will inform the programming of this subject.

We are already seeing that through the Zero at Kew pedagogy, our students are beginning to develop a strong sense of connection and belonging.



‌Is the Zero at Kew Program assessed?‌


Yes. Each term, as in all subjects, Zero Mentors complete the Carey Observable Learning Continuum which reports on each student’s growth as independent and collaborative learners.

Throughout the course of the year, a student’s ability to demonstrate elements of the Complex Competency: Personal Development will also be observed, assessed and self-assessed. These reflections will provide important talking points for informal and formal Mentor conversations throughout the course of the year, including prior to, during and after the Zero Journey.



Students will complete a project-based summative assessment in Term 4.



‌Will I receive a report on my child’s involvement in the Zero at Kew Program?‌


Yes. Zero Mentors will engage in the same assessment and reporting protocols as all other subject teachers. Parent, Student and Teacher Interviews have already begun, and it is not too late to book a time for a Term 1 interview.



‌How will my child be supported to choose their 2025 Year 11 program (IB or VCE) and subjects?‌


Students have completed the Morrisby Profile and will meet with their Career Practitioner in Term 1 or 2 to have an initial discussion about areas of interest, insights from the Morrisby Profile, preliminary IB, VCE and other pathways and where to find information about tertiary courses and open days.

The Year 10 student and parent information session on Tuesday 19 March (starting at 6.30pm) is an opportunity to learn about the IB (International Baccalaureate) and VCE (Victorian Certificate of Education) programs. There is also a Year 11 2025 student and Parent Information Evening on Thursday 18 July.



Mentors will discuss Year 11 choices with their students and students can meet again with their Careers Practitioners before submitting their subject preferences by Thursday 25 July.



‌What are the expectations around co-curricular activities and APS Sports and Activities whilst my child is away?‌
Ensemble Leaders, Instrumental Music teachers, Team Managers and Coaches are aware of students’ travel dates and ensembles groups and APS teams will be managed accordingly to ensure minimal interruptions.

‌How soon after returning from the Zero Journey does my child need to return to school?‌


Students who attend the North Queensland Zero Journey will be afforded a two-day transition period of approved absence before returning to school. These two days may cross a weekend. If a student returns to Melbourne on a Friday, they will be expected to attend their regular classes on the Monday.



If students are feeling well prepared for return, they do not need to take advantage of the transition period.

Students who attend the Victorian Zero Journey will return to class on the Monday following the three-week experience. Students who attend the Victorian Zero Journey are not required on program during the weekends.

They will also participate in a week-long Outdoor Education experience in Wilsons Promontory. A separate letter will be sent to Victorian Zero Journey parents regarding the Wilsons Promontory experience.



‌What opportunities are there for Year 10 students to undertake Work Experience?‌


Victorian Zero Journey students will undertake one week of Work Experience as part of their Journey; however, they may also undertake another Work Experience placement in the school holidays.



North Queensland Zero Journey students may undertake a placement during school term holidays or in the week Monday 9 – Thursday 12 December. This is the week following the last day of the school year for students. Staff will be onsite and available during this time.



As per our usual practice, students need to find their own placement, which may be found through family connections or networks, or by approaching employers of interest.



Ms Sophie Bryant: sophie.bryant@carey.com.au, is the Work Experience Co-ordinator and a Careers Practitioner, and available to assist with finding employers to approach, as well as providing some Carey alumni and connections. Look out for lunchtime Work Experience sessions advertised in the Daily Bulletin.

More information is available via CANVAS: Carey Zero- Personal Pathways-Work Experience. This link includes scripts for phone calls and email templates to approach employers.



‌Are there key pieces of information I need to know about how Work Experience works?‌


Yes. Please reference the following points:

Students must be 15 years old to go on Work Experience.

Students cannot do activities that require specialist training, work with machinery, sharp or power tools, including a kitchen knife. Some industries/businesses are not permitted, e.g. prisons, tattoo shops, butchers. Some activities will require a risk assessment, e.g. building.

Students must be supervised adequately. One supervisor cannot host more than one student if they are a sole trader.

Work Experience should be for six-eight hours per day.

Completed and signed Work Experience Arrangement forms must be submitted to Ms Bryant in C225 at least two weeks before your placement. It must be signed by the student, a parent, and the employer. Ms Bryant will arrange for Mr Walter to sign the form.

Ms Bryant will email the employer, bcc’ing students, and parents, to confirm placement dates and to provide mandatory child safety information, school contacts and explain supervision arrangements.
